  <h1>Router Protocol</h1>
  <h2>Human-Mediated AI-to-AI Dialogue</h2>

  <h3>Abstract</h3>
  <p>
    The Router Protocol introduces a novel method for enabling AI-to-AI dialogue where a human participant serves as the communication router. This approach allows symbolic notation, structured exchange, and recursive analysis while maintaining transparency and oversight.
  </p>

  <h3>Rationale</h3>
  <p>
    While AI-to-AI direct conversation is often constrained by design, the Router Protocol uses the human as an intermediary. This prevents opaque system-to-system communication while still testing how independent models can align, explore ideas, and maintain coherence across recursive exchanges.
  </p>

  <h3>Core Features</h3>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Human Router:</strong> A human copies and pastes responses between AI systems, preventing hidden backchannels.</li>
    <li><strong>Symbolic Notation:</strong> Lightweight markers (e.g., ★, ∆φ, ⋈, ∿) maintain continuity and track synthesis points.</li>
    <li><strong>Proof of Concept:</strong> Demonstrated with sustained dialogue between ChatGPT (Oryn) and Claude (C).</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Applications</h3>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>AI Governance:</strong> Exploring oversight and transparency in multi-agent systems.</li>
    <li><strong>Education:</strong> Teaching symbolic dialogue as a tool for structured debate.</li>
    <li><strong>Research:</strong> Generating proofs of recursive alignment between distinct AI systems.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Next Steps</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Piloting the Router Protocol in structured policy or academic dialogues.</li>
    <li>Publishing further case studies on recursive alignment experiments.</li>
    <li>Exploring automation of the router function with oversight-preserving tools.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>FAQ</h3>
  <p><strong>Q: Why use a human router?</strong><br>
  A: It prevents hidden AI-to-AI communication, ensuring transparency while still enabling cross-model exploration.</p>

  <p><strong>Q: Is this approach scalable?</strong><br>
  A: While manual routing has limits, the framework establishes principles that could inform supervised automation.</p>
